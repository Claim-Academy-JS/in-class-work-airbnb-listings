# React Student Starter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivations

Although the bootstrapping is generally great, React prides itself on 'un-opinionated.' However, as a student, you probably do need a bit more 'guidance' to make your initial learning curve a bit smoother.

That's why I created this template repo. It _does_ include some better linting and also checks for some specific common 'sloppiness.'

Prettier is also included, and I've updated `"browserslist"` to allow us to write our code for modern browsers only - no IE11, etc.

Finally, some choice extensions and settings are also included for VS Code, along with a setting to make sure that Windows users use appropriate line endings.

All of this should limit 'student sloppiness' while reinforcing some 'coding best practices.' ðŸ˜Ž

## Available Scripts

**Run `yarn`. _Do not_ use `npm` as it can lead to some unnecessary conflicts from `yarn` and `npm`.**

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
